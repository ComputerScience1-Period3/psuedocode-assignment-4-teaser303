1. Split a normal card deck of 52 cards into n piles (n is the number of players).

2. The first person puts down the card on the bottom of their deck face up in the middle of all of the players (the players should be in sitting in a circle).

3. Have the next player put their card face down on top of the card before it for:
	until all but 1 player has no cards in their hand.

4. If:
	two cards with the same number are played on top of each other
	three cards are played, with the first and third being of the same number but seperated by the second
	two cards are played, those being a king and a queen
	
Then:
	the players must slap the deck. The first player to slap the deck gets all of the cards played in the round and after they collect the cards, they play the card on top of their deck to start a new round.

5. If:
	a jack is played
	a queen is played
	a king is played
	an ace is played

Then:
	the next player must play a number of cards equal to the number of the previous card % 10. (Note: a jack is worth 11, a queen is worth 12, a king is worth 13, and an ace is worth 14.)
	if the player does not play a jack, queen, king, or ace, the person who played previously gets the all of the cards played in the round.

6. If:
	a person slaps the deck when the conditions of rule #4 is not fulfilled

Then: 
	the person who slapped the deck must take the card off of the top of their pile and place it at the bottom of the deck in play. This card does not count for any slaps, and the players must act like it doesn't exist.

7. The game ends when only one player has all of the cards in a standard deck of 52 cards. The other players must have no cards in their deck.
